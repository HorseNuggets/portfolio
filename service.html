                <p>I am an Eagle Scout, and throughout my years in Scouting, I have given back to the community in many ways, including technical ways. For example, I designed, engineered, and assembled large recycle bins to be placed around Seabrook TX, and I have also managed the <a href="https://www.troop870wubc.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Troop 870 website</a>. I have also participated in various other service projects, including mass trash-collecting efforts along beaches, other scouts' Eagle projects, and food bank volunteering.</p>
                <p>I founded and led a conservation project that started a mass recycling effort in my city. Seabrook, Texas is filled with parks and jogging trails, where disposable water bottle use is extremely common. Throughout my life in Seabrook, I have always noticed an adequate amount of trash cans to minimize littering, but there were no opportunities to recycle empty water bottles throughout the parks and trails.</p>

                <p>Using my knowledge in CAD modeling, I created a recycling bin design for optimal durability and aesthetics, and I obtained a list of the necessary materials. I then presented the design to the Seabrook Open Space and Trails Committee, with my plans on construction, distribution, and establishing locations so that the recyclable materials could be collected on a regular basis. The committee was greatly impressed with my work and decided they would fund the entire project.</p>
                <p>After the meeting, I started planning out the construction process. I informed my Boy Scout troop about my project and collected a list of those planning to help with it. By communicating well with the Scouts and adults, everyone had a clear idea of their role in the project.</p>
                <p>All around Seabrook, the constructed recycling bins are now on display and constantly used.</p>
